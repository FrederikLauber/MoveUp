# MoveUp

A small tool to add a functionality to Windows which is dearly missed,
to move up the files from a selection of folders.

Pretty useful if you extracted many archives and ended up with a folder structure like this:
    
    /Archive01/Datafile1
    /Archive02/Datafile2
    /Archive03/Datafile3

and want to end up like this

    /Datafile1
    /Datafile2
    /Datafile3

Just install MoveUp, select the folders, right click, and select move up :)
